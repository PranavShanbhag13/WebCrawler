This project is a Java-based web crawler using Jsoup to parse and extract data from web pages. It fetches and processes HTML content, extracts text, and follows hyperlinks to recursively explore the web. The crawler includes an indexing component to facilitate data retrieval.

Features<br>
HTML Parsing: Utilizes Jsoup to parse HTML content into Java objects.<br>
Recursive Crawling: Follows hyperlinks to explore web pages up to a specified depth.<br>
Indexing: Integrates an indexing component to process and store fetched data.<br>
Duplicate URL Handling: Maintains a set of visited URLs to avoid redundant processing.<br>
Technologies Used<br>
Java: Core programming language.<br>
Jsoup: For parsing HTML content and extracting data.<br>
HashSet: To manage and track visited URLs.
